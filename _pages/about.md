🕰️ Bio
---
My name is (Gavin) Guanzhou Ke, and I am pursuing my doctoral degree in Information Management at Beijing Jiaotong University. I received my B.S. in Communication Engineering and M.S. in Systems Engineering from Wuyi University in 2019 and 2022, respectively. I’m currently working on multi-view (or modality) representation learning, especially incomplete view scenario. I’m focusing on designing the new fusion method to improve the expressive power of multi-view representation.


🎯 Interested
---
Large Multimodal models, Missing modality completion, Embodied AI.


🔥 Status
---
I expect to graduate in **June 2026**. I am looking for an internship or job in the field of **large multimodal model applications**, especially on unified understanding and generation reasoning. The working place is preferably close to **Shenzhen**, China. If you have any recommendations, please contact me. Thanks.
